Steps:

- Define representation of neurons
- Define representation of layers
- Define how to connect neurons
- Define number of neurons and layers
- Define activation functions
- Define loss functions
- Define backward propagation method
- Define training function and datasets for use

- Try implementing a simple network with a sigmoid function and see where we get
